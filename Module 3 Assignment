Background:
You are tasked with creating a simple command-line Political Party Management System. This system will allow users to manage political parties, their members, and some basic information about each member.

Requirements:

Create a class named PoliticalParty:

Attributes:
name (string): The name of the political party.
founding_year (integer): The year the party was founded.
ideology (string): The political ideology of the party (e.g., conservative, liberal, socialist, etc.).
Methods:
__init__(self, name, founding_year, ideology): Constructor to initialize the attributes.
display_info(self): Method to display the party's information.
Create a class named PartyMember:

Attributes:
name (string): The name of the party member.
age (integer): The age of the party member.
position (string): The role or position of the party member (e.g., leader, spokesperson, member).
Methods:
__init__(self, name, age, position): Constructor to initialize the attributes.
display_info(self): Method to display the member's information.
Implement the following functionalities in the main program loop:

Display a menu with the following options:
Create a new political party.
Create a new party member.
Display information about a political party.
Display information about a party member.
Exit the program.
For each option, prompt the user for necessary information and create instances of the PoliticalParty and PartyMember classes accordingly.
Implement appropriate error handling for user inputs.
Ensure that the program maintains a list of created political parties and party members.

Use object-oriented principles to ensure encapsulation and reusability of code.

Note:

Focus on the core functionality and structure of the program. The user interface can be simple, using command-line input and output.
Ensure proper validation of user inputs to handle potential errors.
Use Python as the programming language for this assignment.
Submission:
Submit a single Python file named political_party_management.py containing the implementation of the Political Party Management System as per the requirements above
